# The Hangman Game

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a single-player Hangman game in the C programming language. In this game, the algorithm selects a random word from a predefined list, and the player attempts to guess the word one letter at a time. The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses before a hangman figure is fully drawn. The game will run in the console and provide an interactive and enjoyable user experience.


## Project Goals

1. Educational Value: Create a project that serves as a learning tool for C programming, including topics like user input handling, randomization, and text-based interface design.
2. Entertainment: Develop a fun and engaging Hangman game that players can enjoy and play repeatedly.
3. User-Friendly Interface: Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions and prompts.
